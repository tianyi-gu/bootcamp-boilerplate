# 🚀 Deployment Checklist for Evaluator

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env` file in root directory with:
```env
ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://tg123:tg123@bootcamp.qsdet76.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Bootcamp
DATABASE_NAME=Bootcamp
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# From root directory
npm run build

# This will install:
# - Root dependencies
# - Backend dependencies (backend/)
# - Frontend dependencies (frontend/)
```

### 3. Verify Database Connection
The MongoDB cluster credentials are already configured in the PRD. The connection will be verified automatically when the backend starts.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Verify `.env` file exists in root directory
- Check MongoDB Atlas credentials
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use

### Frontend won't start
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf frontend/node_modules`
- Reinstall: `cd frontend && npm install`
- Check port 5173 is available

### Database connection errors
- Verify internet connection
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster status
- Confirm credentials match PRD exactly

### CORS errors
- Ensure backend is running on port 3000
- Frontend should be on port 5173 in dev mode
- CORS is configured for all origins in development
